# JVM Basics

## 1. What is JDK?

JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit used to develop Java applications.
It contains:
- Java Compiler (javac)
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Development tools required for development.

## 2. What is JRE?

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) provides the environment required to run Java applications.
It includes:
- JVM
- Core Java libraries

JRE does not contain development tools like the compiler.

## 3. What is JVM?

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is responsible for executing Java bytecode.
It converts bytecode into machine-level instructions specific to the operating system.

---

## 4. What is Bytecode?

Bytecode is an intermediate code generated by the Java compiler.
It is platform-independent and stored in `.class` files.

## 5. Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)

Java follows the principle of **Write Once, Run Anywhere**.

This means:
- Java code is compiled once into bytecode.
- The same bytecode can run on any operating system that has a JVM installed.

This makes Java platform-independent and portable.
